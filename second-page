 <p> Hades is unique in how it approaches the roguelike genre because it includes romance and complex relationships with characters you interact with throughout the game. For example, the player chooses three romance options, one with Megera, a sister of fury, Thantanos, the incarnate of death, and Dusa, a floating gorgon head. <i> (She's lovely, btw). </i> There are also many platonic relationships you can explore, and the chance to strengthen the bond between characters as well <i> (such as the lovers Patroclus and Achilles and Eurydice and Orpheus)</i></p>

 <h2 style="color:white;background-color:red;text-align:center">Soundtrack</h2>
<p>Another thing I <b>LOVE</b> about Hades, is the soundtrack. It is <b>AMAZING</b>, to say the least. There are 22 songs in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5jTYZA6b4VoSRnR5TMldgb"> The Original Soundtrack </a>. The music plays a massive part in the game, each area you encounter as you escape from the underworld has its own tracks, and even some characters sing in the background of specific areas; like Eurydice's song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5N4uTnnwvnREF8qQyCOd7p?si=8fd3b9250cf84600"> <u> "Good Riddance" </u> </a>  you'll hear her sing when you run into her on your way out of <a href="https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Asphodel"> Asphodel </a>. In addition, her lover, Orpheus, whom she'd been separated from, sings the same song in The House of Hades. This disconnected duet further showcases the relationship the two have with each other, as the lyrics allude to their relationship. You'll have to give it a listen, or better yet, play Hades to hear it yourself. </p>

<p> That is all to be said. I bring up this game that came out 3 years ago because <b>there's a sequel coming out! </b> I'm so unbelievably excited about it; the trailer for the game dropped on the 8th of December, 2022. Players like me are still waiting for the announcement with a release date; we can now enjoy screenshots, gifs, and the fantastic animated trailer. We'll be playing the immortal Princess of the Underworld, Melinoe, as she similarly hacks and slashes her way to her objective. There's the promise of more characters, new bosses and enemies, etc. Anyway, play Hades. It's a fantastic game, and I can't wait to play the sequel.
